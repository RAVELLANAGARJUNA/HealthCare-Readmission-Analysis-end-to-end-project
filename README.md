# HealthCare Readmission Analysis — End-to-End Project

This end-to-end data analytics project analyzes patient readmission patterns in a healthcare system using **MySQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**. It identifies key clinical and demographic factors that contribute to readmissions, and builds a professional dashboard to support data-driven healthcare decisions.

---

## Project Overview

**Objective:**  
To uncover actionable insights related to hospital readmissions by analyzing patient-level data such as diagnoses, treatment patterns, and hospital stays.

**Tech Stack:**  
- **MySQL**: Data schema creation, query processing, and storage  
- **Python**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis  
- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation and visual analytics  
- **DAX**: KPI calculations and logic for Power BI

## Key Metrics and Features

- Total number of patients
- Readmission rate (%)
- Short-term vs. long-term readmissions
- A1C result analysis
- Insulin usage and diabetesMed impact
- Diagnoses leading to higher readmissions
- Age, gender, and race distribution analysis

---

## Summary Insights

- Patients aged **60 to 80** have the highest readmission rates
- Diagnoses related to diabetes and heart conditions are leading contributors
- **High insulin usage**, poor **A1C control**, and **longer hospital stays** are key risk factors
- Power BI dashboard enables interactive filtering and real-time drill-down
